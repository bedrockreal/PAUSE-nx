# PAUSE-nx

To use this program, connect a USB mouse to your Switch and press the left button to pause and unpause the game you are in. The right button advances the game by one frame. Games can buffer inputs if you hold then during the pause then either unpause or frame advance. Each segment of pause to unpause is recorded in sdmc:/scripts/pausenx labeled with the time and date. (YOU MUST CREATE THIS FOLDER) The files are in nx-TAS format, so you can replay your recorded TASes.
